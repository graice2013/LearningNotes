#	what is the embedded web server in jenkins, winstone or jetty?
#
before 1.535: winstone
after 1.535:  jetty
[on 1/20/2016] by default: the embedded web container in jenkins is jetty.
And finally, if you are having difficulty installing Jenkins with a container, you can always run Jenkins just by itself: java -jar jenkins.war (which uses Jetty)

Servlet container. Embedded Winstone (before 1.535) or Jetty8 (1.535+, but not in 1.532.1 LTS) vs Tomcat. 
Jetty used to be better on consistent throughput and resource consumption than Tomcat. 
But for recent Jetty 8-9 and Tomcat 7 there are no clear evidence of it.

>>> Winstone is unable to transfer more than 2 Gbytes per request. If a job

>>> Jenkins. 
>>> Switching to Jetty or Tomcat should help in this case.
