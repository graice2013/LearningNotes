## to fix Can't install jenkins slave as a service on Windows Server 2012 R2
## 
Phenomena:
	Error message as shown in the screenshot when installing and later starting the jenkins slave service.
	# as shown in ../jenkins-slave_service_start_error_NosupportedRuntime_of.Net4.0_in_jenkins-slave.xml.jpg :
	Windows could not start the Jenkins Slave service on Local Computer.
	Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.
	
	# as shown in ../jenkins-slave_service_start_error_because_wrong_java.exe_path.jpg :
	The Jenkins Slave service on Local Computer started and then stopped.
	Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs.
	
Solution:
1) extra support for .Net 4.0 ( possibly 2.0) in jenkins-slave.exe.config :
Info: The .Net features installed by default on Windows Server 2012 R2 is shown as in ../Default.NetInstallationStatus_onWinServer2012R2.jpg.
	.NET Framework 4.5 Features (2 of 7 installed): 
		.NET Framework 4.5 (Installed)
		WCF Services (1 of 5 installed)
			TCP Port Sharing (Installed)

2) double check the java.exe executable is correct and runnable in jenkins-slave.xml :
	<executable>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45\bin\java.exe</executable>
3) double check the settings in jenkins-slave.xml are correct,
	i.e., same as those in slave-agent.jnlp.
	  <arguments>-Xrs  -jar "%BASE%\slave.jar" -jnlpUrl http://*:8080/computer/*/slave-agent.jnlp -secret *</arguments>
