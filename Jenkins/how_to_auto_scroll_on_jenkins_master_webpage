# changelog : What's new in 1.598 (2015/01/25)
	Fixed side/main panel scrolling issues. (issue 26312, issue 26298, issue 26306)
	#	ref doc: https://jenkins-ci.org/changelog/

	log in page redirection: http://${jenkins_master1}:8080/login?from=%2F#top

While in Jenkins version 1.596.2, if it's set up as a windows service through:
		jenkins.exe
		jenkins.exe.config
	
scroll to the top of the log in page through "log in". 
Clicking "log in", you'll be re-dicrected to the log in page.
However, if the page expands several screens, the input boxes for "log in" is at the top while the focus could at the bottom,
ex. when there is a long list in "Build Executor Status".



# how to Custom login screen message on jenkins master / jenkins server
#	for a view:
	click the "Add description" link on the top page,
	write the custom message. 
	=> It would appear at the top of the Jenkins top page. 	
	
#	for the whole system:
	go to http://${jenkins_master1}:8080/ -> "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System",
		=> http://${jenkins_master1}:8080/configure/,
	write the custom message into "System Message". 
	=> It would appear at the top of the Jenkins top page. 


Notes: 	The System Message does not appear to the login page and if you allow 
		access to jenkins only to logged users, they will see only the login page. 
		<= 
		Method1: Add "Anonymous" to all "Globral roles", "Project roles" and "Slave roles", the System Message can dock at all jenkins pages including the login page.
		Method2: Manually at "#top" to the log in url, ex. http://${jenkins_master1}:8080/login?from=%2F#top
		Method3: Manually shorten the log in page when it expands several screens, ex. click "collapse" of "Build Executor Status".
