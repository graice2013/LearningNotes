root-cause:
<=> Not enough free disk on jenkins master: for archiving the artifacts.

<= Phenomenon 1. memory usage on jenkins master is > 3.8GB.
<= Phenomenon 2. Job ${Jenkins_job1} failed.
                                Archiving artifacts
                                ERROR: Failed to archive artifacts: **/target/*.*, ...
                                java.io.IOException: java.io.IOException: Failed to extract c:\jenkins\workspace\${Jenkins_job1}@6/transfer of 11933 files

                                Caused by: java.io.IOException: There is not enough space on the disk     

<= Phenomenon 3. the archived artifacts in each ${Jenkins_job1} build takes ~1.28GB, which was 400MB before. Please see the attached screenshot for details.
<= Phenomenon 4. free disk on jenkins master is 10GB.

=> Fix 1. clean disk usage on jenkins master.
=> Fix 2. reboot jenkins master.
