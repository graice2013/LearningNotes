	## Selenium Webdriver info:
		The primary new feature in Selenium 2.0 is the integration of the WebDriver API. WebDriver is designed to provide a simpler, more concise programming interface in addition to addressing some limitations in the Selenium-RC API. Selenium-WebDriver was developed to better support dynamic web pages where elements of a page may change without the page itself being reloaded. WebDriverâ€™s goal is to supply a well-designed object-oriented API that provides improved support for modern advanced web-app testing problems.
