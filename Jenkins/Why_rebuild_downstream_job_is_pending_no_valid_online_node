3)	Why job shows as pending—There are no nodes with the label ‘Job triggered without a valid online node, given where:’ in Rebuild?
•	Phenomenon: 
Job1 has downstream job2, either through “Trigger/call builds on other projects” or “Trigger parameterized build on other projects”, 
job2 has parameters.
Retrigger Job1 through “Rebuild” works, however retrigger job2 failed. The job pends with status:
 (pending—There are no nodes with the label ‘Job triggered without a valid online node, 
	given where:’)

•	Root cause & solution
Job2 has parameters provided through “Node and Label parameter plugin”.
“Node and Label parameter plugin” supports “Rebuilder” plugin since version 1.6 (23. Nov. 2015), 
while “Node and Label parameter plugin” version 1.5.1 is used, so retrigger job2 through “Rebuild” doesn’t work.
	Update “Node and Label parameter plugin” to version > 1.6.
