# why JDK instead of JRE java.exe is needed to run jenkins?
#
need to set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_40"

You are pointing your JAVA_HOME to the JRE which is the Java Runtime Environment.
 The runtime environment doesn't have a java compiler in its bin folder.
 You should download the JDK which is the Java Development Kit.
 Once you've installed that, you can see in your bin folder that there's a file called javac.exe.
 That's your compiler.
