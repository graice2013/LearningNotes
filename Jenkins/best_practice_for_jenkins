# best practice for jenkins users
# 	
1. use Jenkins Plugins productively

2. standarize Jenkins slaves
	install same toolsets, and doing download and installation job automatically ex. through a script.
	for slaves created from an image in Could or VMs: 
		better: spin a slave up from a pre-configured image;
				update the image when slave confiurations need to be updated;
				update the image;
				spin up a new slave instead of updating the existing slaves.
	set up builds on slaves, not run builds on master
	
3. 	use incremental builds when possible for daily and development purpose,
	use full builds for release, and ex. quality build to generate code coverage reports.
	<= maven project type has built-in support for incremental builds. (TODO: need to be updated?)
	
4. integrate with other tools 
	(ex. Gerrit, Jira, Sonar, 
		 Artifacts-Staging ex. through Maven / Groovy / Ivy etc.
		 Chat/IM notifications
		 )
		 
5. balance the jenkins sytem (masters, slaves, builds, etc.)	
	no build on a jenkins master
		Method1: set "# of executors" =0
		Method2: set "Labels" to be different as "Label Expression" in "Restrict where this project can be run" in jenkins jobs
		
	number of slaves less than 1,000
	multi-masters in one jenkins instance: !!NOT!! recommended. <= two jenkins instances.


6. stick with stable releases of Jenkins itself
	use Jenkins core LTS releases. LTS = Long Term Support
	
7. join Jenkins community
