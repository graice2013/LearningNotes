# how to use a jenkins plugin "Build Graph View Plugin"?
# 
This plugin shows a graph of builds that relates together (aka "build pipeline").
It computes a graph of releated builds starting from the current one, and render it as a graph.
Downstream builds are identified by DownStreamRunDeclarer extension point.
	Default one is using Jenkins dependencyGraph and UpstreamCause and as such can detect common build chain.
	build-flow plugin is contributing one to render execution as a graph.
	some Jenkins plugins may later contribute dedicated solutions.
