# expr
#
expr evaluates arguments as an expression.
# ex.
expr text : '.*'
#	Performs a regular expression match. 
#	The regular expression after the colon is matched to the text before the colon. 
#	The returned output is the number of characters that matched. 
#	Here, the regular expression '.*' represents "any number of any character", therefore the result is:
#	4

expr 5 = 5
#	Returns 1 (true) if the expressions are equivalent, or 0 (false) if they are not. 
#	Here, the values 5 and 5 are equal, and therefore equivalent, so the output will be:
#	1
