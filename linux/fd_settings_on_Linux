# fd settings on Linux
#
1) at kernel level, sysctl -a to show it, sysctl to adjust it.
    man sysctl.conf to check help.

2) at user level ex. bash, ulimit -a to show all configurable settings, 
    ulimit -n to adjust fd, could only adjust it no bigger than it at kernel level.
    man limits.conf to check help.
