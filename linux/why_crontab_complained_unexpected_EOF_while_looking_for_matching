# why crontab complained "/bin/sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching ``'"
#
	use \% instead of % in crontab -e command.
	why?
		The command field (the rest of the line) is the command to be run.  The
		entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or % character, will
		be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in the SHELL variable of
		the crontab.  Percent signs (‘%’) in the command, unless escaped with a
		backslash (‘\’), will be changed into newline characters, and all data
		after the first ‘%’ will be sent to the command as standard input.
