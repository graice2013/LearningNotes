# how_to_configure_.gitignore
#
1) .gitignore in the workspace:
    under root directory: applies for the whole workspace by default
    under each sub-directory: applies for this sub-directory
    
2) examples in .gitingore:
    *.pyc
    bin\
    
3) how to ignore files, which are already put into a repository in Git?
    ex.
    git rm -r --cached WebRoot/WEB-INF/classes/**/*
    git commit
    # -r = -recursive
