# Publish Gerrit Change failure: error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://*@*:29418/*.git'

Phenomenon:

	remote: ERROR: missing Change-Id in commit message footer
	remote: 
	remote: Hint: A potential Change-Id was found, but it was not in the footer (last paragraph) of the commit message.
	remote: 
	remote: Hint: To automatically insert Change-Id, install the hook:
	remote:   gitdir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir); scp -p -P 29418 ssh://${account}@${gerrit_server1}:hooks/commit-msg ${gitdir}/hooks/
	remote: And then amend the commit:
	remote:   git commit --amend
	remote: 
	To ssh://${account}@${gerrit_server1}:29418/*/*.git
	! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/publish/rel-5.27 (missing Change-Id in commit message footer)
	error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://${account}@${gerrit_server1}:29418/*/*.git'
	Done

Root Cause:
	Change-Id is missing.
	or
	Change-Id is not at the footer. (There was other info behind Change-Id in this case.)
	
	
Fix:
	install the commit-msg hook.
	update the commit message:
		git commit --amend -m "change file name to fix build issue: ... Change-Id:..."
