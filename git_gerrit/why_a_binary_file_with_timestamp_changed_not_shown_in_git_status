#
# why a binary file with timestamp changed not shown in git status
#
[to be validated]
Using file ${binary_file1} as an example, ex. a .js.
	1) make sure ${binary_file1} not in .gitignore
	2) make sure a binary file is taken as changed when its time stamp is changed
		that is, core.filemode is set to true (default is false)
		In MINGW64 git-bash:

      on Windows OS:
        chmod a+x Source/Radiant.Retail.Now.NowWeb/Localization/Resources.zh-CN.js
        git config â€“global core.filemode true
				git config--local core.filemode true

	3) make sure ${binary_file1} is not marked as assume-unchanged
		git update-index --assume-unchanged PATH 
		git ls-files -v | grep ${binary_file1} | git update-index --no-assume-unchanged

Workaround, once above steps not work: 
    Add a space at the end of ${binary_file1}
