# how to compare files and directories in Python and CLI
#
1) on Windows:  fc for files, robocopy for directories with options (see ref), or windiff tool.
    on Linux:   diff for files
 
2) in Python: 
    Method1. filecmp.dircmp($dir1, $dir2).report_full_closure() + special dealing of the same subdirectories.
              because:
                dircmp will only recurse into common directories, and only if you tell it to.
                If a subdirectory only exists on one side, then the same holds true for its contents.

    Method2. create a subclass of filecmp.dircmp, overrite its phase3() function, compare NOT only os.stat attributes.
              filecmp.dircmp is the way to go. 
              But it does not compare the content of files found with the same path in two compared directories. 
              Instead filecmp.dircmp only looks at files attributes. 
              Since dircmp is a class, you fix that with a dircmp subclass 
                and override its phase3 function that compares files to ensure content is compared 
                instead of only comparing os.stat attributes.
              
              ex. code snippept under CC-BY-SA:
              
                import filecmp 
                class dircmp(filecmp.dircmp):
                    """
                    Compare the content of dir1 and dir2. In contrast with filecmp.dircmp, this
                    subclass compares the content of files with the same path.
                    """
                    def phase3(self):
                        """
                        Find out differences between common files.
                        Ensure we are using content comparison with shallow=False.
                        """
                        fcomp = filecmp.cmpfiles(self.left, self.right, self.common_files,
                                                 shallow=False)
                        self.same_files, self.diff_files, self.funny_files = fcomp
                
                Then you can use this to return a boolean:                
                  import os.path                
                  def is_same(dir1, dir2):
                      """
                      Compare two directory trees content.
                      Return False if they differ, True is they are the same.
                      """
                      compared = dircmp(dir1, dir2)
                      if (compared.left_only or compared.right_only or compared.diff_files 
                          or compared.funny_files):
                          return False
                      for subdir in compared.common_dirs:
                          if not is_same(os.path.join(dir1, subdir), os.path.join(dir2, subdir)):
                              return False
                      return True
