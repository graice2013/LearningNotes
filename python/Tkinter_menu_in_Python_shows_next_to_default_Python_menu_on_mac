# Tkinter menu in Python shows next to default Python menu on mac
# 
1) menu / menubar can be done in Tkinter in two ways:
    top-level menu:  often used in top-level window.
    top-level frame and Menubutton: often embedded in a gui box.
    
2) on Mac, the top-level menu way shows in Python, next to a default built-in Python menu,
            instead of at the poped up window or gui box.
           top-level frame and Menubutton shows at the poped up window or gui box.
           
   on Windows, Linux, both at the poped up window or gui box.
