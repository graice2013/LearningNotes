    sparta      - 支持gui的网络扫描工具
                    "SPARTA is a python GUI application which simplifies network infrastructure penetration testing 
                        by aiding the penetration tester in the scanning and enumeration phase. 
                     It allows the tester to save time by having point-and-click access to his toolkit and 
                        by displaying all tool output in a convenient way. 
                    If little time is spent setting up commands and tools, 
                        more time can be spent focusing on analysing results."
                        
                    "It is recommended that Kali Linux is used as it already has most tools installed,
                        however SPARTA would most likely also work in Debian based systems."
                    
                    "Features
                        – Run nmap from SPARTA or import nmap XML output.
                        – Transparent staged nmap: get results quickly and achieve thorough coverage.
                        – Configurable context menu for each service. You can configure what to run on discovered services. 
                            Any tool that can be run from a terminal, can be run from SPARTA.
                        – You can run any script or tool on a service across all the hosts in scope, 
                            just with a click of the mouse.
                        – Define automated tasks for services (ie. Run nikto on every HTTP service, 
                            or sslscan on every ssl service).
                        – Default credentials check for most common services. 
                            Of course, this can also be configured to run automatically.
                        – Identify password reuse on the tested infrastructure. 
                            If any usernames/passwords are found by Hydra they are stored in internal wordlists
                            which can then be used on other targets in the same network 
                            (breaking news: sysadmins reuse passwords).
                        – Ability to mark hosts that you have already worked on so that you don’t waste time 
                            looking at them again.
                        – Website screenshot taker so that you don’t waste time on less interesting web servers."

    OWASP ZAP   - 用python实现的OWASP ZAP-features API
                    "The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular free security tools.
                    It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications, 
                    ts also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing."
                    
                    OWASP = Open Web Application Security Project
                            "开放式Web应用程序安全项目（OWASP，Open Web Application Security Project）是一个非营利组织，
                            它提供有关计算机和互联网应用程序的公正、实际、有成本效益的信息。其目的是协助个人、企业和机构来发现和使用可信赖软件。"

    pythem      - 多用途的安全测试工具 Peneration Testing Framework
                    "pythem is a multi-purpose pentest framework written in Python. 
                    Only runs on GNU/Linux OS."
                    
                    pip install pythem
