# how to fix 'str object has no attribute css_to_xpath Exception'
#
1) Phenomenon:
    Exception: str object has no attribute css_to_xpath Exception

2) Root cause:
    'with lxml 2.4 (not released yet) when lxml.cssselect becomes a thin wrapper around cssselect. 
    The CSSSelector class and HtmlElement.cssselect method remain for compatibility.'
    
3) Fix:
    usage example:
        import lxml.html, lxml.cssselect
        
        tree = lxml.html.fromstring(html)
        row = []
        for f in FIELDS:
            selector = tree.cssselect(r'table > tr#places_%d__row > td.w2p_fw' % f)
            if selector:
                row.append(selector[0].text_content)
        return row
