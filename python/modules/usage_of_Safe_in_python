# usage of Safe in python
#
1) Safe will check if the password has a simple pattern, for instance:
    password is in the order on your QWERT keyboards.
    password is simple alphabet step by step, such as: abcd, 1357
    
    Safe will check if the password is a common used password. 
    Many thanks to Mark Burnett for the great work on 10000 Top Passwords.
    Safe will check if the password has mixed number, alphabet, marks.
    
2) pip install safe
    >>> import safe
    >>> safe.check('abc')
    >>> res1 = safe.check('x*V-92Ba')
    >>> print('{}\t{}\t{}'.format(res1.valid, res1.strength, res1.message))
        True	strong	password is perfect
