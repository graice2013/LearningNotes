#
# difference between mvn jshint:lint and mvn -Pjshint jshint:lint
#
1) mvn jshint:lint works 
	when:
	1.1) jshint:lint is defined in project -> build -> plugins -> plugin -> com.cj.jshintmojo:jshint-maven-plugin
	or
	1.2) project -> profiles -> profile is defined and profile is set:
		(id="jshint") and (activeByDefault="true")
	
2) mvn -Pjshint jshint:lint works
	when:
		project -> profiles -> profile is defined and profile is set:
		(id="jshint") and (activeByDefault="true") or (activeByDefault="false") (default value.)
