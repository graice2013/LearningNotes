#
# clean an installed package from local repository ex. %USERPROFILE%\.m2
#
Method 1. 
mvn dependency:purge-local-repository -DmanualInclude="G:$A:$V" -DreResolve=false
mvn dependency:purge-local-repository -DmanualInclude="G:$A" -DreResolve=false
#	using the Apache Maven Dependency Plugin. 
#	It includes the dependency:purge-local-repository functionality that removes the project dependencies from the local repository, and optionally re-resolve them.
#	To clean the local dependencies you just have to used the optional parameter reResolve and set it to false since it is set to true by default.


Method 2:
 for .jars which have been manually installed, I would recommend manually deleting, 
 because maven creates some weird files like yourjar.jar.lastUpdated and yourjar.pom.lastUpdated 
 which you may need to manually delete anyway.
