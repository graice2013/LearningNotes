# vim E492: Not an editor command: ^M on mac
#
1) vim settings are set up in ~/.vimrc, however, vim complained error when vim file1:
  vim E492: Not an editor command: ^M
  
  # root cause:
  line ending on Windows is \r\n, on Mac (and all unix/linux) is \n. 
  Mac couldn't parse \r => complained as ^M error.
  
  # fix:
  in ~/.vimrc:
    %s/\r//g
    :set fileformat=unix    # set the fileformat to unix
    :wq!
    
  => done.
