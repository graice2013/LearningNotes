# usage of lag, lead in RDB
#
1) use lag to get field from last row.
    use lead to get field from next row.
    offset can be negative <=> lag and lead could do same work.
    
    LAG ...
    LEAD ( scalar_expression [ ,offset ] , [ default ] )     OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause )
    
    example:
        select value as v1, lead(value, 1) over(order by value) as v2
        from table1
        where value > 1
        order by event_type ASC, time;
       
        # [to be validated] select v1-v2 
        # [to be validated] from (...)

2) lag, lead is supported at least in SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle. Not in MySql yet.
