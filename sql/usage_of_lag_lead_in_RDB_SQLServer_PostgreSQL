# usage of lag, lead in RDB
#
1) use lag to get field from last row.
    use lead to get field from next row.
    offset can be negative <=> lag and lead could do same work.
    
    LAG ...
    LEAD ( scalar_expression [ ,offset ] , [ default ] )     OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause )
    
2) lag, lead is supported at least in SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle. Not in MySql yet.
