# how to run perfmon on windows 2008
#
Commands:
%windir%\system32\perfmon.exe
%windir%\system32\perfmon.exe /res

1. What is the perfmon counter "%Committed Bytes in Use":
	ex. 
	% Committed Bytes In Use = 9.013 max, 4.305 min.
	paging file = 262070MB
	What does Memory \ %Committed Bytes in Use mean ?
        % Committed Bytes In Use is the ratio of Memory \ Committed Bytes to the Memory \ Commit Limit. 
        Committed memory is the physical memory in use for which space has been reserved in the paging file should it need to be written to disk. 
		The commit limit is determined by the size of the paging file.  If the paging file is enlarged, the commit limit increases, and the ratio is reduced). 
		This counter displays the current percentage value only; it is not an average.
		If this value is consistently over 80% then your page file may be too small.
