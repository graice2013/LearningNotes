Certificate Propagation 
	Copies user certificates and root certificates from smart cards into the current user's certificate store, 
	detects when a smart card is inserted into a smart card reader,
	and, if needed, installs the smart card Plug and Play minidriver.
	
	该服务为智能卡提供证书服务，默认手动，不使用智能卡的话可以将其禁用，不过手动也不碍事。
