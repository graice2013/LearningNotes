# javascript runs in single thread and also in asynchronus steps
#
1) javascript runs in single thread, but also do asynchronus.
    through main thread: stack, heap
          + task queue
          + event loop
          + navigator API

    navigator has other threads too, ex. Event handler, timer etc.
    setTimeOut() and setInterval() are used to put callback into task queue.
      setTimeOut(callback, timeout,...) : runs callback in timeout ms.
      setInterval(...) : runs callback every ...
    
    
2) javascript runs ajax mainly through XmlHttpRequest(), 
    XmlHttpRequest by default it access urls with same origin.
    
    javascripts runs ajax in 3 ways to access resources with other origins:
      A) flash
      B) proxy, ex. /proxy?...
      C) jsonp. Creates 'script' element dynamically, which accesses resources with other origins.
         jsonp supports only 'GET' and returns only javascript.

    from html5, Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing(CORS) strategy is supported to access resources with other origins.
      CORS needs that remote that must support Access-Control-Allow-Origin(ACAO).
